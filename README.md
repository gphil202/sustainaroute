The eco-friendly journey planner

## Project setup
The project code was set up with Python 3.10 and PyCharm as an IDE in mind. Using different IDEs or an older Python version might work, but may lead to problems when relying on specific features.

### Installing dependencies
If you're on a Windows system and have Anaconda installed, simply install all required libraries via:
_pip install -r requirements.txt_

If you're using a different operating system or have e. g. a native Python installation, run:
_pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow pytest_ . The command will resolve and install the corresponding libraries for your system.
